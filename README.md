# Editor

Write_Code™. Nothing Else.

After trying out virtually every online python interepreter, (and not liking any of them) I built my own.

# Why this Editor?

- It has no ads, no popups, no memberships, no sign-ins, no purchases, no telemetry etc. and hence no bloat. 
- The website UI is so minimalistic that it has no buttons at all! 
- Everything happens through keyboard shortcuts, which not only make you faster but also lets you focus more on the code, less on the details.
- It's generic as hell and doesn't force any idealogy on you. It is what you make it to be.
- It runs on "YOUR" browser, not mine. It's completely serverless and runs on WebAssembly.
- All features in it are tailored for maximum productivity - from themes to fonts to shortcuts to everything.
- It's most suited for running small code snippets for rapid testing and prototyping. It's also recommended for beginners since it basically just requires a web browser and nothing else.
- This level of minimalism both in design and by design can be found nowhere on the internet. This is basically the ArchLinux of Editors.

# Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter**: Run code
- **Ctrl/Cmd+Left Arrow**: Expand Output
- **Ctrl/Cmd+Right Arrow**: Expand Code
- **Ctrl/Cmd+K**: Open a new instance
- **Ctrl/Cmd+S**: Export file
- **Ctrl/Cmd+O**: Import file

# Usage

To install any (supported) packages, simply use micropip (python's pip equivalent):

```python
await micropip.install("<package_name>")
```
